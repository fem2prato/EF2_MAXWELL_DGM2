.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Matlab's base handle class (documentation generation substitute) 

As doxygen does not know the class 'handle' from itself, many classes do not get rendered within the documentation and the correct root class is not even displayed\&. This workaround guarantees a correct (also graphical) representation of the class hierarchy\&.
.PP
Note here that by having the type handle it could also mean to have a vector or matrix of handles\&.
